Dataset Access

The dataset is available for access through Google Cloud Storage bucket at: "gs://senfloods11/"

You can access the dataset bucket using the gsutil command line tool. If you would like to download the entire dataset (~14 GB) you can use gsutil rsync to clone the bucket to a local directory. The -m flag is recommended to speed downloads. The -r flag will download sub-directories and folder recursively. See the example below.

$ gsutil -m rsync -r gs://sen1floods11 /YOUR/LOCAL/DIRECTORY/HERE
If using an example notebook, you can download the dataset to the folder that notebooks expect it to be in by running


$ mkdir /home/files
$ gsutil -m rsync -r gs://sen1floods11 /home/files
